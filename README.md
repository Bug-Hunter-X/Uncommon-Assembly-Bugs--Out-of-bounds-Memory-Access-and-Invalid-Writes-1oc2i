This repository demonstrates two uncommon but potentially problematic bugs in assembly code:

1. **Out-of-bounds memory access:** The `mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]` instruction accesses memory based on the values of `ebx`, `ecx`, and a constant offset. If `ecx` is larger than expected, it could cause the program to read from a memory address outside the program's allocated memory region. This is known as an out-of-bounds memory access and it often leads to crashes or unexpected behavior.

2. **Invalid memory writes:** The `mov [edi + 0x20], eax` instruction writes the value in the `eax` register to the memory location pointed to by `edi` plus a constant offset.  If `edi` is not properly initialized or points to a memory area outside the program's allocated memory, this could cause a crash or data corruption.

The `bugSolution.asm` file shows how to prevent these issues.  Proper bounds checking on array indices (ecx in the first case) and careful initialization of pointers (edi in the second case) are crucial for writing robust and secure assembly code.
